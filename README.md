# How to add the appointments using the onTap callback in the Flutter Calendar?

A quick-start example to help you to add the appointments using the onTap callback in the Flutter Calendar.

You can add appointments to the Flutter Event Calendar by tapping cells and using the Calendar's [onTap](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_calendar/latest/calendar/SfCalendar/onTap.html) callback. The onTap callback triggers whenever the calendar is tapped. For recurrence appointments, the tap details will always return as an Appointment, even for the custom business object.

* date - returns the selected date.
* appointments - returns the selected appointments.
* targetElement - returns the element tapped.

You can also refer our UG documentation to know more about [onTap](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_calendar/latest/calendar/SfCalendar/onTap.html) callback.
